Focus:
-Solve the problem on running RobotC
	-Cannot select self-edited file for model

Steps to check:
-Check the setting of RobotC to make sure no problem (No problem)
-Use a license from Professor Majeed to re-active (Not work)
	-Remember to decline the license before the end of semester
-Restart the laptop after installation (Not work)
-Use the license file from Professor Majeed (Not work)

Result:
-This problem is a dead end, because even if we can load our file, we cannot create the model which can run the file on RobotC

Works before next meeting:
-Install ROS on laptop and try to run
-Check the Nvidia Isaac simulation
	-Might use in future
	-do some research about it
-Check the new manipulator Agile X PiPER
