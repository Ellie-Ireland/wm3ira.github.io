Focus:
-Roughly describe how the software RobotC works
	-RobotC does not have manipulator

Setting RobotC:
-Install RobotC
	-VEX Version
-Install RVW
	-Robot Virtual World
	-Add License for RVW VEX
-Change to RVW
	-Robot > Compiler Target > Virtual World

Describe the theory of Robot moving:
-Point Turn
	-Same speed but different direction for both side wheels
-Normal Turn
	-One side fast and the other side slow
-Straight move
	-Two side have the same speed

Run default assignments in RobotC simulator:
-Let robot move forward with the same speed and stop at a fix distance between Robot and wall
-Let robot move forward at one speed and then slow down until get the fix distance
-Files contains user defined model
	-Check the standard models in Example files and try to design own
	-Implement robot design will be project and we will do so in RobotC
		-Can get the kit easier
