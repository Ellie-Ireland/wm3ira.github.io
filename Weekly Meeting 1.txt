Our Focus:
-How to make AI Robot work together - Robot arm to grasp and Robot to get data about environment
and target, and transfer data to Robot arm
	- try to make them smart

Situation right now:
-Still waiting on hardware (1 to 2 months)
-Starting with software

Knowledge we will use:
-Machine Vision
	-recognize the target
	-check the environment to move Robot arm in front of target
	-decide the distance between Robot arm and target for grasping
	-check the shape of target and change the way to grasp
-Machine Learning
	-identify which is the target
	-decide how to grasp
	
Robot we might use:
-ROSbot 2R
	-can add Robot arm at top
	-with sensers
	-small size, might not stable after installing Robot arm
	-can be used for mapping
-Openmanipulator X
	-Robot arm
	-with 4 joints
	-can be install on surface
-Turtlebot 3 Waffle Pi
	-can add Robot arm at top
	-with senser
	-huge size, stable for Robot arm after installing Robot arm

Software might use:
-ROS robot operating system (Linux based)
-Gazebo: 3D environment simulator for ROS
-RobotC: other software have simulator and coding for VEX Robotics (C programming)

Objectives:
-knowledge of target location
-Pick it up & retrieve it
-Navigation & Manipulation

Before next meeting:
-check the details about all robot today talked about
-decide what robot will choose with teammate
